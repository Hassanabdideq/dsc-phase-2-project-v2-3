# Data understanding
The King County House Sales project dataset is stored in a file named kc_house_data.csv, accompanied by column descriptions available in column_names.md. It contains information relevant to house sales in King County, providing a comprehensive set of features. To streamline the analysis, specific columns such as date, view, sqft_above, sqft_basement, yr_renovated, zip code, lat, long, sqft_living15, and sqft_lot15 can be excluded based on project recommendations. The dataset is the foundation for the primary project goal: regression modeling to predict house prices. Stakeholders are expected to be identified, and the analysis should address pertinent business problems, possibly involving advice for homeowners on how renovations impact home value. The modeling approach centers on linear regression, with a focus on building iterative models. The iterative process involves starting with a basic model, evaluating its performance, and then refining or iterating based on those evaluations. Evaluation metrics for overall model performance are required, and the project encourages the exploration of additional statistical techniques beyond linear regression if they contribute value. Clear documentation, transparency in decision-making, and, optionally, data visualization and analysis are emphasized for effective communication and reproducibility throughout the project.
